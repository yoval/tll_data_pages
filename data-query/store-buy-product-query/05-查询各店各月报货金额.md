### 查询各店各月报货金额

#### 通过详单查询

```sql
WITH day_period AS (
    SELECT CAST('2025-01-01 00:00:00' AS DATETIME) AS start_date,  -- 开始日期时间
           CAST('2025-02-28 23:59:59' AS DATETIME) AS end_date     -- 结束日期时间
),
-- 拼接订单
report_order AS (
    SELECT 
        t1.id AS 订单ID,
        t1.order_num AS 订单编号,
        t1.order_status AS 订单状态,
        t1.order_time AS 订单时间,
        t1.order_type AS 订单类型,
        t1.order_notes AS 订单备注,
        t1.store_code AS 门店编码,
        t1.actual_amount AS 实际金额
    FROM flink_rps_all_new_tll_order_now_day_df t1
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 
        t2.id AS 订单ID,
        t2.order_num AS 订单编号,
        t2.order_status AS 订单状态,
        t2.order_time AS 订单时间,
        t2.order_type AS 订单类型,
        t2.order_notes AS 订单备注,
        t2.store_code AS 门店编码,
        t2.actual_amount AS 实际金额
    FROM dwd_rps_tll_order_di t2      
),

-- 选择唯一订单ID
unique_orders AS (
    SELECT 
        订单ID,
        订单编号,
        订单状态,
        订单时间,
        订单类型,
        订单备注,
        门店编码,
        实际金额,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY 订单ID ORDER BY 订单时间 DESC) AS rn
    FROM report_order
),

order_table AS (
    SELECT uo.*
    FROM unique_orders uo
    CROSS JOIN day_period dp
    WHERE uo.订单时间 BETWEEN dp.start_date AND dp.end_date
      AND uo.订单状态 >= 3
      AND uo.订单状态 != 5
      AND uo.rn = 1
)

SELECT 
    ot.门店编码,
    SUM(ot.实际金额) AS 报货金额,
		DATE_FORMAT(订单时间, '%Y-%m') as 月份,
    CONCAT(DATE_FORMAT(dp.start_date, '%Y-%m-%d'), '~', DATE_FORMAT(dp.end_date, '%Y-%m-%d')) AS 时段
FROM order_table ot, day_period dp
GROUP BY ot.门店编码,DATE_FORMAT(订单时间, '%Y-%m'), CONCAT(DATE_FORMAT(dp.start_date, '%Y-%m-%d'), '~', DATE_FORMAT(dp.end_date, '%Y-%m-%d'));
```


#### (简化)通过订单查询


```sql
WITH day_period AS (
    SELECT CAST('2025-01-01 00:00:00' AS DATETIME) AS start_date,  -- 开始日期时间
           CAST('2025-02-28 23:59:59' AS DATETIME) AS end_date     -- 结束日期时间
),
-- 拼接订单
report_order AS (
    SELECT 
        t1.id AS 订单ID,
        t1.order_time AS 订单时间,
        t1.store_code AS 门店编码,
        t1.actual_amount AS 实际金额,
        t1.order_status AS 订单状态
    FROM flink_rps_all_new_tll_order_now_day_df t1
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 
        t2.id AS 订单ID,
        t2.order_time AS 订单时间,
        t2.store_code AS 门店编码,
        t2.actual_amount AS 实际金额,
        t2.order_status AS 订单状态
    FROM dwd_rps_tll_order_di t2      
),
-- 选择唯一订单ID
unique_orders AS (
    SELECT 
        订单ID,
        门店编码,
        实际金额,
        订单时间,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY 订单ID ORDER BY 订单时间 DESC) AS rn
    FROM report_order
    WHERE 订单状态 >= 3
      AND 订单状态 != 5
)

SELECT 
    uo.门店编码,
    SUM(uo.实际金额) AS 报货金额,
    DATE_FORMAT(uo.订单时间, '%Y-%m') AS 月份,
    CONCAT(DATE_FORMAT(dp.start_date, '%Y-%m-%d'), '~', DATE_FORMAT(dp.end_date, '%Y-%m-%d')) AS 时段
FROM unique_orders uo
CROSS JOIN day_period dp
WHERE uo.订单时间 BETWEEN dp.start_date AND dp.end_date
  AND uo.rn = 1
GROUP BY uo.门店编码, DATE_FORMAT(uo.订单时间, '%Y-%m'), CONCAT(DATE_FORMAT(dp.start_date, '%Y-%m-%d'), '~', DATE_FORMAT(dp.end_date, '%Y-%m-%d'));
```

#### 进一步简化，只查询截至昨天的表

这种查询方式会丢失今日的订单数据

```sql
WITH day_period AS (
    SELECT CAST('2025-01-01 00:00:00' AS DATETIME) AS start_date,  -- 开始日期时间
           CAST('2025-02-28 23:59:59' AS DATETIME) AS end_date     -- 结束日期时间
)
SELECT 
    t.门店编码,
    SUM(t.实际金额) AS 报货金额,
    DATE_FORMAT(t.订单时间, '%Y-%m') AS 月份,
    CONCAT(DATE_FORMAT(dp.start_date, '%Y-%m-%d'), '~', DATE_FORMAT(dp.end_date, '%Y-%m-%d')) AS 时段
FROM (
    SELECT 
        id AS 订单ID,
        order_time AS 订单时间,
        store_code AS 门店编码,
        actual_amount AS 实际金额,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY id ORDER BY order_time DESC) AS rn
    FROM dwd_rps_tll_order_di
    WHERE order_status >= 3
      AND order_status != 5
) t, day_period dp
WHERE t.订单时间 BETWEEN dp.start_date AND dp.end_date
  AND t.rn = 1
GROUP BY t.门店编码, DATE_FORMAT(t.订单时间, '%Y-%m'), dp.start_date, dp.end_date;
```

#### 中台网页版查询方式

数据不包含当日产生的订单

```sql
WITH day_period AS (
    SELECT CAST('2025-01-01 00:00:00' AS DATETIME) AS start_date,  -- 开始日期时间
           CAST('2025-02-28 23:59:59' AS DATETIME) AS end_date     -- 结束日期时间
),
time_range AS (
    SELECT CONCAT(LEFT(start_date, 10), '~', LEFT(end_date, 10)) AS 时段
    FROM day_period
)
SELECT 
    t.门店编码,
    SUM(t.实际金额) AS 报货金额,
    LEFT(t.订单时间, 7) AS 月份,  -- 提取 'YYYY-MM' 格式的月份
    tr.时段
FROM (
    SELECT 
        id AS 订单ID,
        order_time AS 订单时间,
        store_code AS 门店编码,
        actual_amount AS 实际金额,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY id ORDER BY order_time DESC) AS rn
    FROM dwd_rps_tll_order_di
    WHERE order_status >= 3
      AND order_status != 5
) t, day_period dp, time_range tr
WHERE LEFT(t.订单时间, 10) BETWEEN LEFT(dp.start_date, 10) AND LEFT(dp.end_date, 10)
  AND t.rn = 1
GROUP BY t.门店编码, LEFT(t.订单时间, 7), tr.时段;
